                CEDAT, Water and Earth Documentation Center, is located in the
                beautiful setting of Palazzo Camilli. The aim is to create a
                study center that will become a point of reference regarding the
                topic of "Water".
                <br /> <br />
                CEDAT, (Water and Earth Documentation Center), is spread over
                two levels within Palazzo Camilli, the latter located in the
                historic center.
                <br />
                <br />
                The first level, developed on the ground floor and in the two
                rooms of the building, represents the two elements that
                characterize Nocera: water, with its three main springs
                Angelica, Cacciatore and Flaminia, and the earth, with its
                different uses, for therapeutic purposes and in the processing
                of White Limestone. <br />
                <br />
                The second level, set up on the second floor, is home to a
                permanent exhibition to which will be diversified and renewed
                over time: the history of the Nocera Bath, the advertising
                created by Felice Bisleri, as well as the presentation of the
                various water points in the area. <br />
                <br />
                Two conference rooms equipped with the necessary computer
                support, finally, on the second floor of the structure, as well
                as the headquarters of the cultural association "L'Arengo."
